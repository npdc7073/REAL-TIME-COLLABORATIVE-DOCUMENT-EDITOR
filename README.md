# 📄 Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor

A web application that enables multiple users to **simultaneously edit a document in real time**, with instant updates and robust synchronization.

---

## 🚀 Demo & Features

- Live collaborative editing — every keystroke syncs instantly for all users.
- User authentication with **Register / Login** flow and secure access to protected pages.
- Document management: 💾 create, open, and save individual documents.
- Real-time presence indicators — see active collaborators with cursors/colors.
- Conflict resolution via OT/CRDT algorithms.
- Built with modern tech stack (detailed below).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer      | Technology                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend** | Your preferred framework (React / Vue / Vanilla JS) |
| **Backend**  | Node.js + Express (or NestJS) + WebSocket (Socket.IO or ws) |
| **Database** | MongoDB / PostgreSQL for persistent storage |
| **Realtime Sync** | Operational Transform / CRDT library |
| **Auth & Security** | JWT authentication & secure endpoints |
| **Styling**  | Modern CSS or SCSS, responsive design |

## 🧭 Getting Started

### 🔧 Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Create .env with e.g. MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, PORT
npm run dev       # or npm start
````

### 🎨 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start         # Opens app in browser
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port) to use the app.

## 🔒 Authentication Flow

1. **Register** with email/password → JWT stored in `localStorage`.
2. Upon **Login**, JWT is used to access secure endpoints + socket auth.
3. **Protected routes/pages** check JWT; redirect to login if missing/invalid.
4. **Logout** completely clears session and redirects to landing page.

## ✍️ Real-Time Collaboration

* Socket.IO (or "ws") handles live editing events:

  * `join-document`
  * `text-change`
  * `cursor-position`
* Backend broadcasts changes to all connected clients in the same document/room.
* Clients apply broadcast changes dynamically — no refresh needed!

---

## 💡 Why this project?

* Learn essential full-stack skills with real-time data sync.
* Great base for building feature-rich collaborative apps (collab docs, drawing apps).
* Clean architecture and modern best practices.
* Easily extendable with comments, permissions, file attachments, and more.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:

```ini
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONDO_URL
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

## 📈 Further Enhancements

* Enable document version history and rollback features.
* Add text formatting (rich-text, markdown, headings).
* Role-based access: owner, editor, viewer.
* Real-time chat integrated into document view.
* Comment threads and inline suggestions.
* Deployable via Docker and CI/CD pipelines.
